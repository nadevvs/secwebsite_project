- misconfig exposure (default configs)

3. Mitigations

- no root login, very strong password policy
- ufw only allowing ssh from anywhere and only cloudflare ip ranges for web ports
- cloudflare proxy enabled
- fail2ban enabled to decrease probability of intrusion
- nginx configured, no defaul site, hidden files, server version disclosure disabled
- second firewall enabled at vps dashboard
- vps dashboard protected with mfa
- dnssec enabled
- for mail: mx, spf, dkim, dmarc records set up
